Million song dataset (not the spotify one) can be merged with taste profile dataset (contains user, song, playcount triplets). They have the same song ID

1. Million song dataset - http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/#subset
2. Taste profile - http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile/
    - 48M user-song-play count triplets
    - 1M unique users
